			<h2>Rigorous phase-space approach to impurity effects in thermal Hall transport</h2>
			<p>In the presence of disorder, the anomalous Hall effect does not consist solely of the simple clean Berry curvature contribution.
			Can one still derive rigorous results, in particular in the framework of kinetic theory?
			Here, we derive systematically the semiclassical coordinate shift contributions to the kinetic equation, both for the thermal Hall effect of neutral bosons
			and for the electrical Hall effect of fermions as a byproduct, induced by disorder with any local hamiltonian structure.

			<h2>Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances</h2>
			<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for
realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures with comparable (and large) densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures.
			We predict the transport properties of such Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance.
			When driving a hole current, the response of all constituents of the mixture
			(doped holes, excitons, and trions) are significantly impacted by the resonant interactions.
			Our results on the temperature-dependent conductivities demonstrate that resonant interaction effects
			actually dominate the transport response in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.

			<h2>Anomalous quantum oscillations from boson-mediated interband scattering</h2>
			<p>Quantum oscillations (QO) in metals refer to the periodic variation of thermodynamic
			and transport properties as a function of inverse applied magnetic field.
			QO frequencies are normally associated with semi-classical trajectories of Fermi surface orbits.
			Here, we develop a theory of composite frequency quantum oscillations (CFQO) in 2D Fermi liquids
			with several Fermi surfaces and interband scattering mediated by a dynamical boson.
			Specifically, we show that CFQO arise from oscillations in the fermionic self-energy
			with anomalous frequency splitting and distinct strongly non-standard temperature dependencies.

			<h2>Emergent Gauge Theories in Spin-Orbital Loop Models</h2>
			<p>We are developing a parton construction for defects in fluctuating loop states emerging from spin-orbital models
			in three spatial dimension. This allows us to explore spin-liquid-like phases and critical points of lattice gauge theories
			while evading confinement in the U(1) sector, as well as various striped ordered phases.

			<h2>Quantum kinetic equation and thermal conductivity tensor for bosons</h2>
			<p> How can one study the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity of bosons from a kinetic equation viewpoint?
			We show that this arises from identifying, in phase space, the correct choice of "kinetic coordinates"
			which allows to diagonalize the evolution operator in a gauge-invariant way, using the formalism of the star-product.
			We obtain the local energy current operator for any quadratic theory of chiral bosons without assuming translational invariance,
			which allows to study locally the edge currents as well as inhomogeneous systems.

			<h2>Thermal Hall conductivity from inelastic scattering of phonons by fermionic spinons</h2>
			<p> What are mechanisms for a phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators that do not exhibit magnetic order,
			so where TR is not explicitly broken at the ground state level?
			We are studying the inelastic scattering of phonons with fermionic spinons in quantum spin liquids,
			and more generally with fermions (be they neutral or charged) in various contexts,
			and the mechanisms whereby a thermal Hall conductivity may appear.<br/><br/>

		<h2>Thermal Conductivity and theory of inelastic scattering of phonons by collective fluctuations</h2>
			<p>Here we ask very concretely: by which microscopic mechanisms are time-reversal breaking and chirality communicated to the lattice,
			so that the SSB state of spin degrees of freedom enables a thermal Hall conductivity of phonons?
			After a more general discussion of the implications of symmetry and detailed balance, we focus on square-lattice antiferromagnets. <br /><br />

			<h2>Phonon thermal Hall conductivity from scattering with collective fluctuations</h2>
			<p> Because electrons and ions form a coupled system, it is a priori clear that the dynamics of the lattice
			should reflect symmetry breaking within the electronic degrees of freedom. In particular, there can be thermal Hall effect of neutral particles.
			We derive this via many-body scattering of bosonic carriers by collective modes,
			providing fundamental new results for such skew scattering and the consequent thermal Hall conductivity formulated in terms of correlation functions.

				<h2>Condensation with Two Constraints and Disorder</h2>
			<p>	When a set of positive random variables is constrained by two global conservation laws, it may undergo a 'condensation'
			transition, whereby a few randomly picked variables carry all the weight.
			This may be understood as ergodicity breaking on intermediate time scales,
			because exploration of the full phase space manifold is (dramatically) frustrated due to the global constraints.
			Now, how does disorder affect the microcanonical statistics of such classical systems?
